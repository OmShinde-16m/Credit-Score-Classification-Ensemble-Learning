# Credit Score Classification Ensemble

Credit Score Classification Ensemble is a machine learning project that predicts customer credit scores using ensemble learning techniques. The project demonstrates the application of multiple models-such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and K-Means Clustering-to classify and analyze credit scores from tabular customer data. It provides a clear workflow for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and ensemble strategies.

This README will guide you through the setup process, usage, and key features of the project.
